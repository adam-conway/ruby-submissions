Notes:

* Too may attr_readers
* Too much in initialize
* Don't need to rename variables for Text.new
* Need to work on your naming of variables and methods
* if you're checking for 0 or 1 as flags, you should use a boolean
* Try to use less flags
* Runners needs to be refactored for readability
  * Do this by making abstract, high level methods
* attr_readers should each be on a new line

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 2

- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP


### 3. Test-Driven Development: 3

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   


### 4. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
