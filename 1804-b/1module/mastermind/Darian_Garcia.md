Notes:

* Colors should be stored in an array, not a hash
* I like the use of helper methods in the start method. Play should be a helper method
* Play method is too long
* "p".downcase will just be "p"
* Bug when using = instead of ==


The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [ ] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [ ] Code is indented properly
- [ ] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [ ] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP


### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   


### 4. Functionality

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
