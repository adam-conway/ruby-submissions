Notes:

* time array in text class is a great place for a hash
* Don't put data type in variable name
* Rename Text class to something about user input
* If you are nesting, probably a good sign for a refactor
* You should break your runner file into methods
* Variable names aren't idomatic
* Generating the answer based on difficulty could be it's own method
  * This would ensure dynamic functionality
* Can use optional params instead of accessors to make testing possible

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP


### 3. Test-Driven Development: 3

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   


### 4. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
