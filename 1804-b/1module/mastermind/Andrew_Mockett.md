- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP


### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   


### 4. Functionality
