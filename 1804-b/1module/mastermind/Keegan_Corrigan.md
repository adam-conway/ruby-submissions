Notes:

* computer_sequence should be renamed
* Don't store an IVar if it can be easily calculated
* player_guess shouldn't be an IVar, it should be returned and used as local variable
* Instead of using puts and gets in your methods, return strings and take strings as inputs
* Breaking like_elements and exact_elements into methods is great example of breaking logic into components
* name block variable index instead of i
* Make sure you are asserting values, not classes
* Use assert instance of instead of assert_equal something.class
  

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP


### 3. Test-Driven Development: 3

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   


### 4. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
