Notes:

* Make sure your naming follows convention
* attr_readers/writers should be the first thing in the class
* Starting state should be set as arguments to initialize, not as methods
* opportunities to refactor in mastermind.rb. Move logical chunks of code into their own methods
* Some lines call too many methods i.e. 4 or 5 method calls
* Testing random should also test that the colors are right
* prefer enumerable over loops and counters
* Don't transpose expected and actual

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [ ] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [ ] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP


### 3. Test-Driven Development: 3

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   


### 4. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
