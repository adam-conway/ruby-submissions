- [X] Methods do not break the principle of SRP

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [X] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [X] Functionality is accurately covered
- [X] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
  - Would like to see more robust integration tests
- [X] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [X] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
- [X] Test Coverage metrics exceed 95%

- [ ] 4: Above expectations

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [X] 3: Meets expectations
  - Make sure your commit messages are descriptive of the work - if something is broken, the message should start with 'WIP' (work in progress)
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 5. Functionality

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extensions not required for a 3)

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [X] 2.8: Very very close to Meets expectations (crack is missing a piece)
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations
