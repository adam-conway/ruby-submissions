Notes:
* Output text is not dynamic
* Crack does not work
* 25 tests, 30 assertions, 100 percent coverage
* Overabundance of instance variables
* Some methods are too long

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately

- [x] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used only when necessary)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [ ] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
- [x] Code has been linted and corrected properly.

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [x] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
- [ ] Methods do not break the principle of SRP

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [x] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [x] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
- [x] Test Coverage metrics exceed 95%

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [x] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 4. Git Workflow

- [ ] Developers commit at a rate of approximately one commit every 30 minutes.
- [ ] Repository shows the use of branches.
- [ ] Developers use a pull request workflow.
- [ ] Developers resolve HoundCI complaints in their pull requests.

- [x] 4: Above expectations
- [ ] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 5. Functionality

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extensions not required for a 3)

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [ ] 3: Meets expectations
- [x] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations
