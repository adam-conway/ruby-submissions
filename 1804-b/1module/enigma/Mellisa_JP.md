## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

- [X] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation   
- [X] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
  - Names were very clear and specific but let's work on shortening for readability!
- [X] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [X] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used only when necessary)
- [X] Code is indented properly
- [ ] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
  - some long names contributed to this!
- [X] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
- [X] Code has been linted and corrected properly.

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [X] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
  -   - Great job pulling out key and offset classes, would like to see encrytor/decryptor pulled out into classes
- [X] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
- [X] Methods do not break the principle of SRP

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [X] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics exceed 95%

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [ ] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 4. Git Workflow

- [X] Repository demonstrates that each member of team has contributed fairly equally.
- [X] Developers commit at a rate of approximately one commit every 30 minutes.
- [X] Repository shows the use of branches.
- [X] Developers use a pull request workflow.
- [X] Developers resolve HoundCI complaints in their pull requests.

- [ ] 4: Above expectations
- [X] 3.5: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations

### 5. Functionality

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extensions not required for a 3)

- [X] 4: Above expectations
- [ ] 3: Meets expectations
- [ ] 2: Below expectations
- [ ] 1: Well-below expectations
