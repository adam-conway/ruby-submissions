Notes:

* Make sure you follow the spec. Each node should hold a title and a score
* Node class is not fully tested. There need to be tests for assigning attribute values, not just reading
* You should test the structure of the tree, not just return values and inclusion
* Remember to be as specifiic as possible in testing. Don't just assert values are greater than other values, assert their exact value
* Shouldn't have variables that are just the data type, i.e. 'array'

- [x] Testing exhibits TDD approach

### 4. Version Control: 2

Expectations:

- [x] Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [ ] Developer implements branching and PRs
- [x] The final submitted version is merged into master

### 5. Functionality: 3
