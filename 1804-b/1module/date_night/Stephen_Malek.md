Notes:

* Don't store the depth on the node
* Need tests that cover the Node class functionality
* Spaceship <=> should be used when you NEED an integer
* Could refactor case/when to if else
* Your tests should be as specific as possible. For example, don't just test after an insert that the node is in the tree, test that it is in the right spot
* Good job following the spec
* Because your child count method can take a node argument, you should test that
* Don't name your variable it's datatype, i.e. 'array'
