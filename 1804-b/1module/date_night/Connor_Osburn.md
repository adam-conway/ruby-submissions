Notes:

* Should have a node test
* Methods are too long. Should be broken into helper methods (which then need to be tested)
* You need more spacing in between operators like ==, =, !=, > 
* Make sure you're following the spec. I should be able to initialize an empty tree
* recursive_sort method is very elegant. Good job!
* Don't name a variable it's datatype, i.e. 'array'
* Try to be as specific as possible in your tests. For instance, don't just check that the node is in the tree, check that it's in the right spot.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [ ] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes 
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines 
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP 


### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style  
- [x] Tests exist to cover edge cases
- [ ] Tests covers critical functionality of software
- [x] Testing exhibits TDD approach

### 4. Version Control: 2

Expectations:

- [x] Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [ ] Developer implements branching and PRs
- [x] The final submitted version is merged into master

### 5. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
