Assessor: Holt

Notes: You know how to tell Ruby to do what you want - I'd like to see you push yourself to maximize the power of Ruby and do it more efficiently, with cleaner code (specifics in # 2 below)

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style - 3.5

- [-] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
  - find_amex_from_other - a little confusing of a method name
- [X] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [X] Code is indented properly
- [X] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components - 2

- [X] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [-] May break the principle of SRP
  - Would like to see that if/else broken out
  - Use the tools ruby gives you! i.e. map vs. each
  - Would like to see passing arguments rather then methods relying on other methods

### 3. Test-Driven Development - 3

Expectations:

- [X] Each method is tested  
- [X] Functionality is accurately covered
- [X] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [X] Balances unit and integration tests
- [X] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [-] A test RakeTask is implemented

## 4. Functionality - 4

- [X] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
