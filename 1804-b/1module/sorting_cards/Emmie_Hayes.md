Notes:

* Good edge case testing if a value comes into a card as an integer
* test_response_is_a_string is redundant
* Tests for guess class should not cover card functionality
* Testing concat_card_attributes is a good example of unit testing
* Great use of helper methods in record_guess
* Always be as specific as possible with assertions. Use assert_equal instead of assert_instance_of wherever you can

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

### 4. Functionality: 3

- [ ] 4: Completes Iteration 4 and one extension.
- [x] 3: Completes Iteration 3
- [x] 2: Completes Iteration 2
- [x] 1: Completes Iteration 1
