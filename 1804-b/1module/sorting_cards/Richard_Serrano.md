Notes:

* Missing Round class
* Missing test for card suit
* Need to work on naming tests
* Too much functionality is tested in test_that_the_guess_is_right
* Deck test has two tests that are named the same

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations

- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2
