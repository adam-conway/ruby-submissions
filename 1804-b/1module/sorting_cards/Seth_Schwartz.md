## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style - 4

- [X] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [X] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [X] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [X] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [X] Code is indented properly
- [X] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [X] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components - 3

- [X] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [X] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [X] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development - 2.5/3.5

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [X] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
  - There are some huge wins! (3.5)
    - Asserting and refuting your methods that return true/false in order to test happy and sad path
  - There are some areas I'd like you to work on (2.5)
    - A few places where you are testing the methods of a class - in a different classes test file.
    - Tests should cover more edge cases - example: card should not only test "Ace" and "Spades" as we could get a false positive if "Ace" and "Spades" were hard-coded.

### 4. Functionality 3

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

- [ ] 4: Completes Iteration 4 and one extension.
- [X] 3: Completes Iteration 3
- [X] 2: Completes Iteration 2
- [X] 1: Completes Iteration 1
