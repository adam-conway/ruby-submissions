## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style 3

- [X] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [X] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [X] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [X] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [ ] Code is indented properly
- [X] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [X] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components 3

- [X] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [X] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [X] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development 2

- [ ] Each method is tested
    - Would like to see more coverage, example: card should not only test "Ace" and "Spades" as we could get a false positive if "Ace" and "Spades" were hard-coded.
- [X] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

### 4. Functionality 2+ (wrote a sort that's not 100% working)

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

- [ ] 4: Completes Iteration 4 and one extension.
- [ ] 3: Completes Iteration 3
- [X] 2: Completes Iteration 2
- [X] 1: Completes Iteration 1
