Notes:

* Be as specific as possible in your assertions. Use assert_equal over assert_instance_of
  * For example, in Round, asserting the right deck
* Should not have have a cards_sorted or counter instance variable
* Rename the variable counter to something more specific
* Round#record_guess should return the new Guess object
*

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2
