### 2. Breaking Logic into Components - 3

- [X] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [X] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [X] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development - 2

  - A few tests named in a way to indicate they were testing a method - they were calling a method, but then testing a different method. `record_guess` was the method not tested
- [X] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

### 4. Functionality 1.5+ (just didn't return card out of record_guess)

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
