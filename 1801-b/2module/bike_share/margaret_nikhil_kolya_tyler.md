## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

- Instructor: Ian
- Heroku app: https://bike-share-sf.herokuapp.com/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/lilwillifo/bikeshare

### Notes:

- great styling
- views are calling model code to fetch db data
- models need to use sql binding parameters and not call the same helper methods over and over


### 1. Feature Completeness

* Exceeds Expectations: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions and project is deployed
* **Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented and project is deployed**
* Below Expectations: There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented and/or project is not fully deployed

### 2. Views

* Exceeds Expectations: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
* **Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers**
* Below Expectations: Views don't make use of partials or show weak understanding of `render`

### 3. Controllers

* Exceeds Expectations: Controllers show significant effort towards refactoring and pushing logic down the stack
* **Meets Expectations: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer methods that need refactoring**
* Below Expectations: There are four or more controller methods that should have been refactored

### 4. Models

* Exceeds Expectations: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
* **Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring**
* Below Expectations: Models are somewhat messy and/or make poor use of Rails features

### 5. ActiveRecord

* Exceeds Expectations: Best choice ActiveRecord methods are used to solve each problem
* **Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord**
* Below Expectations: Ruby is used to programmatically solve problems where ActiveRecord could be used

### 6. Testing

* Exceeds Expectations: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels and utilizes mocking & stubbing
* Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that covers all functionality and tests at multiple levels
* Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels

### 7. Usability

* Exceeds Expectations: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
* **Meets Expectations: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready**
* Below Expectations: Project needs more attention to the User Experience, some views need to use a URL to visit them

### 8. SASS

* Exceeds Expectations: Project utilizes SASS to its fullest
* **Meets Expectations: Project utilizes SASS but does not harness its unique functionality**
* Below Expectations: Project does not utilize SASS

### 8. Workflow

* Exceeds Expectations: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, peer and instructor  code review, rebasing and a project management tool.
* **Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, peer and instructor code review, rebasing, and a project-management tool.**
* Below Expectations: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.

### 9. Documentation

* Exceeds Expectations: Excellent README which gives users an exemplary guide to the what and how your application
* **Meets Expectations: A custom README is present and gives users an guide to the what and how your application**
