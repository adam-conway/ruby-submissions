Notes:

* Iteration 1 average items per merchant takes a very long time
* It would be easier to check if a key is changeable rather than if it is unchangeable
* Good use of Repository and FileLoader module
* Tight coupling makes testing much harder. Lots of methods go untested

## Evaluation Rubric

- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests
- [x] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [x] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
- [x] A test RakeTask is implemented

### 4. Functionality: 3
